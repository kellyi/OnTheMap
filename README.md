OnTheMap
========

OnTheMap is the third app from Udacity's [iOS Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003). It's the capstone app for the course on [iOS Networking with Swift: Web Services, APIs, and JSON](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-networking-with-swift--ud421). 

The app lets Nanodegree students share their locations and see other shared locations plotted on a map or presented in a table view. It uses Udacity's API for user authentication and the Parse API to store and retrieve student location data.
